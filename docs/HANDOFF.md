# MEGA CHAD — Handoff for Sandwich the Frog

**Hey Burger.** Yes, you. BurgerTheToad. Baguette the Amphibian. This doc is for you.

You don't need to understand any of this. You have AI that does everything. You just type what you want in English. Like ordering food, except the waiter is a genius and you're... you.

**Live preview:** https://mega-chad.vercel.app
**Repo:** https://github.com/megachadxyz/mega-chad

---

## THE ONLY 3 THINGS YOU ACTUALLY DO

### 1. Install Cursor

Go to https://cursor.com. Download it. Install it. Open it. Sign in.

That's it Burger. That's the hard part. You did it. Gold star.

### 2. Open the AI chat

Press **Ctrl+L** (or **Cmd+L** on Mac). A chat panel opens on the right side. This is your AI assistant. It can do literally everything. You just talk to it.

### 3. Copy-paste this into the chat

```
Help me set up the mega-chad project. The repo is at https://github.com/megachadxyz/mega-chad — clone it, install everything, and open it in this editor. If I'm missing anything like Node.js or Git, walk me through installing those first.
```

The AI will handle everything from there. Follow what it says. If it asks you to click something, click it.

From this point forward, **you never need to read another line of this document.** Just talk to the AI. It has access to all these files and knows what everything does.

## COPY-PASTE PROMPTS

Below are ready-made prompts you can copy-paste into Cursor's AI chat (Ctrl+L). Just grab whichever one you need, Biscuit the Newt.

---

### Change how the site looks

```
Change the background color to dark purple
```

```
Make the main headline say "BURN TO CREATE" instead of whatever it says now
```

```
Make the font bigger on the hero section
```

```
Change the pink color to something more red
```

```
Add a new image to the carousel. The file is on my desktop called newchad.jpg — move it into the project and add it
```

```
Remove the Andrew Tate card from Notable Chads
```

```
Change the burn amount from 1000 to 500 everywhere on the site
```

```
Swap the music. I put a new mp3 on my desktop called newtrack.mp3 — replace the current one
```

---

### Preview the site on your computer

```
Run the dev server so I can preview the site locally
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. That's your local preview. Changes show up in real time.

---

### Make changes live for everyone

```
Push all my changes to GitHub and deploy to Vercel
```

---

### Fix stuff when it breaks

```
The site won't load. Fix it.
```

```
The burn button isn't working. Fix it.
```

```
Everything is broken and I don't know what happened. Help.
```

If you see an error message, just paste it in:

```
I'm getting this error: [PASTE THE ERROR HERE]
```

---

### Deploy the token contract

```
Deploy the token contract to MegaETH testnet with dev wallet 0xPUT_YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE
```

```
Update the contract address displayed on the site to 0xPUT_THE_NEW_ADDRESS_HERE
```

```
Run the smart contract tests to make sure everything passes
```

---

### Set up API keys for production

```
Help me set up the API keys for this project so the burn-to-create feature works in production. Walk me through each one step by step. The services I need are Replicate, Pinata, and Upstash.
```

---

### Move hosting to your own Vercel account

```
Help me transfer this project's Vercel hosting from the contributor's account to the megachadxyz organization's own Vercel account. Walk me through every step.
```

---

### Connect the megachad.xyz domain

```
Help me connect the megachad.xyz domain to our Vercel deployment. Tell me exactly what DNS records to add and where.
```

---

### Understand the project

```
Explain this entire project to me like I'm five
```

```
What does the burn-to-create feature do? How does the 50/50 split work?
```

```
What file controls the roadmap section?
```

---

## SUPERCHARGE IT: ADD CLAUDE CODE

You have Claude Code passes. Claude Code is even more powerful than Cursor's built-in AI — it can edit dozens of files at once, deploy to Vercel, push to GitHub, and handle complex multi-step stuff.

To install it, paste this into Cursor's AI chat:

```
Install Claude Code for me. I need to run "npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code" in the terminal. If npm isn't installed, help me install Node.js first. After it's installed, open a terminal and run "claude" so I can log in.
```

Once installed, open the terminal in Cursor (press `` Ctrl+` ``) and type `claude`. Now you have TWO AIs:

| AI | How to open | Best for |
|----|------------|----------|
| **Cursor chat** | Ctrl+L | Quick questions, small edits |
| **Claude Code** | Terminal → type `claude` | Big changes, deploying, multi-file edits |

You're basically a tech company now. CEO: Flatbread the Tadpole.

## WHAT'S DONE

- Full website (hero, about, burn-to-create, roadmap, notable chads, footer)
- Image carousel with music
- Wallet connect (MetaMask, Brave Wallet, Phantom, etc.)
- Burn-to-create: type a prompt, burn 1000 tokens, get AI art
- 50/50 split: 500 burned forever, 500 to dev wallet
- AI image generation (Replicate)
- IPFS permanent storage (Pinata)
- Gallery page
- Smart contract (14 tests passing)
- Pink is `#F786C6` (you're welcome)
- Buy links go to kumbaya.xyz

## WHAT'S NOT DONE

Just copy-paste the relevant prompt from above when you're ready. The AI does the work. You watch. Your specialty, Panini the Frog.

- Deploy the token contract
- Put the real contract address on the site
- Set up API keys on Vercel
- Move hosting to your own Vercel
- Connect megachad.xyz domain
- Add a favicon

---

## HOW THE SITE WORKS (you don't need to memorize this)

```
User connects wallet
  -> Types a prompt ("jacked chad on the moon")
  -> Clicks BURN (costs 1,000 $MEGACHAD)
  -> 500 tokens burned forever (deflationary)
  -> 500 tokens sent to dev wallet (funds the team)
  -> AI generates an image
  -> Image saved to IPFS permanently
  -> User gets their art
```

---

## IF YOU'RE TRULY STUCK

1. Ask the AI. Seriously. Just describe what's wrong.
2. If the AI is confused too, screenshot the error and send it in the group chat.
3. If Cursor itself won't open: uninstall it, reinstall it from https://cursor.com
4. If your computer is on fire: that's a you problem, Ciabatta the Gecko.
