# MEGA CHAD — Handoff for Sandwich the Frog

**Hey Burger.** Yes, you. BurgerTheToad. Baguette the Amphibian. This doc is for you.

You don't need to understand any of this. You have AI that does everything. You just type what you want in English. Like ordering food, except the waiter is a genius and you're... you.

**Live preview:** https://mega-chad.vercel.app
**Repo:** https://github.com/megachadxyz/mega-chad

## THE ONLY 3 THINGS YOU ACTUALLY DO

### 1. Install Cursor

Go to https://cursor.com. Download it. Install it. Open it. Sign in.

That's it Burger. That's the hard part. You did it. Gold star.

### 2. Open the AI chat

Press **Ctrl+L** (or **Cmd+L** on Mac). A chat panel opens on the right side. This is your AI assistant. It can do literally everything. You just talk to it.

### 3. Tell it what you want

Type this into the chat:

> Help me set up the mega-chad project. The repo is https://github.com/megachadxyz/mega-chad — clone it, install everything, and open it in this editor. If I'm missing anything like Node.js or Git, install those for me too.

The AI will:
- Check what you're missing
- Install it for you (or tell you exactly what to click)
- Clone the repo
- Install dependencies
- Open the project

From this point forward, **you never need to read another line of this document.** Just talk to the AI. It has access to all these files and knows what everything does.

## THINGS YOU CAN SAY TO THE AI

You don't need to remember commands, file names, or anything technical. Just say what you want like you're texting a friend who happens to be a software engineer. Here's some ideas to get your toad brain going:

**Changing the site:**
> change the background color to dark purple

> make the headline say something different

> swap out the music for this new mp3 I put on my desktop

> add a new image to the carousel

> change the burn amount from 1000 to 500

**Seeing your changes:**
> run the site locally so I can preview it

(Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser)

**Making it live:**
> push my changes and deploy to vercel

**When stuff breaks:**
> it's broken. fix it

> I'm getting this error: [paste whatever you see]

**Contract stuff:**
> deploy the token contract to MegaETH with dev wallet 0x1234...

> update the contract address on the site to 0xABCD...

**Understanding things:**
> what does the burn-to-create feature do?

> explain this project to me like I'm five

That last one was made for you specifically, Croissant the Salamander.

## SUPERCHARGE IT: ADD CLAUDE CODE

You have Claude Code passes. Claude Code is even more powerful than Cursor's built-in AI — it can edit dozens of files at once, deploy to Vercel, push to GitHub, and handle complex multi-step stuff.

To install it, just ask Cursor's AI chat:

> Install Claude Code for me. I have a Claude Code pass from Anthropic.

It'll walk you through it. Once installed, you open the terminal in Cursor (press `` Ctrl+` ``) and type `claude`. Now you have TWO AIs:

| AI | How to use | Best for |
|----|-----------|----------|
| **Cursor chat** (Ctrl+L) | Chat panel on the right | Quick questions, small edits |
| **Claude Code** (terminal) | Type `claude` in terminal | Big changes, deploying, fixing complex bugs |

You're basically a tech company now. CEO: Flatbread the Tadpole.

## STUFF THAT'S DONE

- Full website (hero, about, burn-to-create, roadmap, notable chads, footer)
- Image carousel with music
- Wallet connect (MetaMask, Brave Wallet, Phantom, etc.)
- Burn-to-create: type a prompt, burn 1000 tokens, get AI art
- 50/50 split: 500 tokens burned forever, 500 to dev wallet
- AI image generation (Replicate)
- IPFS permanent storage (Pinata)
- Gallery page
- Smart contract ready
- Pink is `#F786C6` (you're welcome)
- Buy links go to kumbaya.xyz

## STUFF THAT'S NOT DONE

Just tell the AI to do any of these when you're ready:

- **Deploy the contract** — "deploy the token contract to MegaETH with dev wallet 0x..."
- **Set the real contract address** — "update the contract address to 0x..."
- **Set up API keys on Vercel** — "help me add the API keys to Vercel so the burn feature works in production"
- **Move hosting to your own Vercel** — "help me transfer this to the megachadxyz Vercel account"
- **Point megachad.xyz at it** — "help me connect megachad.xyz domain to our Vercel deployment"
- **Add a favicon** — "add a favicon to the site"
- **Teach Burger how computers work** — estimated completion: never

## API KEYS (the AI will help you set these up)

Before the burn feature works in production, you need accounts at these sites. All free. Just tell the AI:

> Help me set up the API keys for this project. Walk me through each one.

It'll tell you exactly where to go, what to click, and where to paste the keys. The services are:

| Service | What it does | Sign up |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Replicate | Makes the AI images | https://replicate.com |
| Pinata | Saves images forever | https://pinata.cloud |
| Upstash | Prevents double-burns | https://upstash.com |

## HOW THE SITE WORKS (for context, not for you to memorize)

```
User connects wallet
  -> Types a prompt ("jacked chad on the moon")
  -> Clicks BURN (costs 1,000 $MEGACHAD)
  -> 500 tokens burned forever (deflationary)
  -> 500 tokens sent to dev wallet (funds the team)
  -> AI generates an image
  -> Image saved to IPFS permanently
  -> User gets their art
```

This is called "tokenomics" Burger. Don't worry about it. The AI knows.

## IF YOU'RE TRULY STUCK

1. Ask the AI. Seriously. Just describe what's wrong.
2. If the AI is confused too, screenshot the error and send it in the group chat.
3. If Cursor itself won't open: uninstall it, reinstall it from https://cursor.com
4. If your computer is on fire: that's a you problem, Biscuit the Newt.
